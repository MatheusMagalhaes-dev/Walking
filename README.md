#Animation with HTML and CSS
In this project, I created a simple animation using only HTML and CSS. 
The animation consists of an image that changes according to the time programmed in the CSS.

#Animation Preview
Here's a preview of the animation:
<a href="#">Preview Here</a>

#How it Works
The animation is created using CSS properties position, left, and animation. The circle is created with a <div>
element that has a fixed size and is styled with the border-radius property to create the circular shape.

The animation is defined using the animation property and consists of one step (@keyframes): 
The only step is only in the exchange of images, the time is defined by another property

How to Run
To run the animation, simply open the index.html file in any web browser.

How to Edit
To edit the animation, simply open the index.html file and modify the CSS properties as necessary. 
It's possible to change the speed of the animation, and the size of the element, among other things.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how it's possible to create simple animations using only HTML and CSS. Although the possibilities are limited compared to other technologies such as JavaScript and vector-based animations, 
it's still possible to create fun and interactive animations using only the basic resources of CSS.
